12/04/01 - I wrote this application to demonstrate to you the functions of the winsock component.  This also makes use of the rich text box control, and the timer.  This program provides the functionality of forwarding a particular port's TCP traffic from your computer to another with 2 separate winsock objects.  It also provides functionality to monitor and record all data passed through, and automatically reconfigure itself for another connection attempt when one has closed.  All data is logged with the source IP.  Hopefully some of you may find use in this!
